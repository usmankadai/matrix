# matrix
## Rules of engagement:
Coding exercise
*	Pick a development environment
*	Write some code to solve the exercise

Team review
*	For each example we’ll spend 5 minutes to 
  *	See a demo of the code running
  *	Have a look at the source code
  *	Highlight pros and cons of the selected approach
*	Fill in the skill matrix
*	Select the coding example for the next session
This week’s task
*	Working in teams of at least 2 people (managers have a force multiplier of 2 😉), create a [m x n] matrix library
*	m and n are integers
*	0 < n ≤ 5
*	0 < m ≤ 5
*	The matrix library shall include, but is not limited to, functions for:
*	Matrix addition
*	Matrix multiplication
*	Return Matrix inverse
*	The matrix library functions shall have an error response
*	The project shall use at least one GitHub action
*	The project shall have unit testing of at least 90% code coverage
*	The project must have one function demonstrated within the timebox

Elements to be peer-reviewed
*	Demonstrate teamwork skills (collaborative working)
*	Project has at least one relevant and useful GitHub action (Working with GitHub)
*	Project has a standard, logical, interface. (Interfaces/APIs)
*	Project implements above requirements (Implementation against standard)
*	Quality of unit tests
*	Design process

Next challenge should be powerBi as that is our weakest skill overall.
