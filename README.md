# matrix
Rules of engagement:
Coding exercise
*	Pick a development environment
*	Write some code to solve the exercise
Team review
*	For each example weâ€™ll spend 5 minutes to 
  *	See a demo of the code running
  *	Have a look at the source code
  *	Highlight pros and cons of the selected approach
â€¢	Fill in the skill matrix
o	Select the coding example for the next session
This weekâ€™s task
â€¢	Working in teams of at least 2 people (managers have a force multiplier of 2 ðŸ˜‰), create a [m x n] matrix library
â€¢	m and n are integers
â€¢	0 < n â‰¤ 5
â€¢	0 < m â‰¤ 5
â€¢	The matrix library shall include, but is not limited to, functions for:
o	Matrix addition
o	Matrix multiplication
o	Return Matrix inverse
â€¢	The matrix library functions shall have an error response
â€¢	The project shall use at least one GitHub action
â€¢	The project shall have unit testing of at least 90% code coverage
â€¢	The project must have one function demonstrated within the timebox

Elements to be peer-reviewed
â€¢	Demonstrate teamwork skills (collaborative working)
â€¢	Project has at least one relevant and useful GitHub action (Working with GitHub)
â€¢	Project has a standard, logical, interface. (Interfaces/APIs)
â€¢	Project implements above requirements (Implementation against standard)
â€¢	Quality of unit tests
â€¢	Design process

Next challenge should be powerBi as that is our weakest skill overall.
